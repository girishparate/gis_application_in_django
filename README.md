# gis_application_in_django
This project is to demonstrate geodjango functionality. In this project, i have used gdal, proj, geos and GeoIP2 libraries.
However, the documentation has been given in GeoDjango section of django contrib packages.
The dataset that i have used here to get Ip information is from maxmind free dataset.

<h2>Step 1 : You need to first install all the required packages e.g. GDAL, GEOS, PROJ, PROJ-DATA etc</h2>
1) link for documentation for installation of these packages :
  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/contrib/gis/install/geolibs/

<h2>Step 2 : After step 1, you will have install or create postgis and raster extension for postgres</h2>

Other changes has been completed in the project itself.
